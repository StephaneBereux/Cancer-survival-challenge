    "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. One in nine women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime ([INCa avril 2016](https://www.ligue-cancer.net/article/26094_cancer-du-sein)). Approximately 70% of breast cancer patients are inoperable because of advanced tumor growth or bone metastasis [Min Tao et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21512769/). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore crucial to be able to accurately diagnose the disease, and to better understand the aggravating factors. Here we propose to predict the survival based on the genetic factors of the tumour."

    "#### Genetic information <a name=\"genetic_information\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The human being is made up of approximately $10^{13}$ cells. These cells are not immutable: on the contrary they are themselves living entities, which are born, live and die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each human cell has its genetic information contained in [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA#Biological_functions), a molecule with excellent storage capacities thanks to its stability and its faithful transmission from the mother cell to the daughter cells. This information is divided into genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During its life, the cell is led to express part of this information (e.g. part of the genes), by translating it into molecular tools. \n",
    "The modalities of expression differ according to the genes, but for the vast majority, the beginning of the expression process is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transcriptome <a name=\"transcriptome\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To be expressed, each gene is first [transcribed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)) into multiple copies of itself, in the form of [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA#Comparison_with_DNA) molecules (a molecule close to DNA). Each copy of RNA contains the same genetic information as the original gene, but in a more reactive (and therefore more ephemeral) form than DNA. This makes it more accessible for expression.\n",

    "*(The further expression of the genetic information is beyond the scope of this challenge, but essentially consists of two possibilities: either the RNA molecule is directly used as a molecular tool, or an additional step takes place ([translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology))) which translates the RNA molecule into a protein.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression of a gene is therefore controlled by the number of RNA copies produced for each gene. The set of RNA molecules in a cell is called the [transcriptome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome). \n",
    "Here we (classically) propose to use the transcriptome as a proxy to infer the expression of each gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will see in the following part, the main difficulty of this challenge will be to reduce the dimension of the very high-dimensional transcriptomic data (expression data for more than 35000 genes), in order to accurately predict the survival time of breast cancer patients."

    "*[Survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis)* is a branch of statistics designed to model the life or activity time of a living being or device. Widely used in medicine and particularly in oncology, it allows to process data often *[censored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics))* over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Censored data consist in data for which the observed event (e.g. death for this challenge) is only partially known. As far as oncology is concerned, it is inevitable that patients become out of reach or leave the study before the measured event (death), which leads to *right-censored* data. This means that a lower bound on the patient's life time is known, but not its exact value.\n",

    "Classic statistical tools such as regression are then poorly adapted and may underestimate the lifetimes studied (if they consider that the time at which the patient leave the study is its time of death).\n",

    "\n",
    "This is why many specific methods, often derived from classical statistical models, have been developed for survival analysis, and are notably implemented in the [```scikit-survival```](https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/index.html) or [```pysurvival```](https://square.github.io/pysurvival/) Python libraries.\n",

Indeed, in addition to a classical dataset with $n$ samples, containing the $d$-dimensional features in the matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{nd}$ and the associated target values in the vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, a survival dataset includes a third information : $E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This vector contains a boolean indicator for each sample, telling if the event has occured (e.g. the patient $i$ is dead $\\iff E_{i} =1$) or not (e.g. the patient $j$ is censored $\\iff E_{j} = 0$).\n",

    "You can choose to ignore the information given by $E_{\\texttt{train}}$ (or include it only in the design of the features). If you do so, you can then create a classic regressor, such as those provided by [```scikit-learn```](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning), which uses only $X_{\\texttt{train}}$ and $y_{\\texttt{train}}$.\n",

    "We will now present some tools for gene by gene survival analysis. In particular, the two tools that will be presented can be used to identify genes that particularly discriminate between patients, and use them as a feature for regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list does not pretend to be exhaustive, but only to give some possible leads.\n",

    "#### A few definitions <a name=\"definitions\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this introduction to survival analysis more readable, we can assume that time is a discrete variable i.e $t \\in \\{1,...,n\\}$ with $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\tau \\geq 0$ be the random variable giving the time before a relevant event happen. Usually, survival prediction aims to estimate the *survival function* $S$ which define  $\\tau$, where $S$ is defined by :\n",
    "$ {\\displaystyle S(t)=\\mathrm {Prob} (\\tau >t)}$\n",

    "However, we limit ourselves to predicting the life time of the patients. (It could for example be estimated from such a survival function by setting a threshold $d$ below which we consider that the patient dies. The life time of a patient would then be $argmax_{t} \\text{  s.t.  } S(t) > d$)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also make the (*very strong*) assumption that the censors (the patients leaving the study) are non-informative (e.g. they don't have anything to do with the subject studied, in other words they can be considered random)."

    "#### The Kaplan-Meier estimator <a name=\"kaplan_meier\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kaplan-Meier estimator is one of the most classic tool of survival analysis. Indeed, it is a non-parametric estimator (eg.g it does not make any assumption on the data distribution accross time), quite simple to implement, and it uses the information from the censored lineage.\n",
    "The Kaplan-Meier estimator can be written : \n",
    "${\\displaystyle {\\hat{S}}(t)=\\prod_{i:t_{i}\\leq t}\\left(1-{\\frac{d_{i}}{n_{i}}}\\right)}$. \n",

    "where $t_i$ is a time when at least one event happened, $d_i$ the number of event at time ${\\displaystyle t_{i}}$ and $n_i$ the individuals still in the study (neither dead nor censored) at time $t_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the product to compute ${\\hat{S}}(t)$ is on all time less than t, and thus allows to take into account all patients, even those *censored* before time $t$ because they got out of the reach of the study.\n",
    "\n",
